                    The eventuallity of the project is to help dentists in real-life
                    scenarios to make desirable decisions. Therefore, testing is a 
                    crucial part of the overall project. To ensure that our app is 
                    functioning properly we have gone through extensive testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unit and integration testing consists of testing actual functionalities
                    of the app in our code. From basic functions (unit testing) to whole 
                    systems (integration testing). We have further split this type of testing
                    into two parts:
                </p>
                <ul class="num-list">
                    <li>
                        Automated Testing - tests we have programmed to automatically check
                        whether specific functions are working. This mainly pertains to back-end
                        functionalities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Manual Testing - tests we have conducted through manual interaction with
                        the actual app. This mainly consists of testing the front-end performance.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Finally, we have also decided to test our app with the feedback of others, such
                    as our client and project supervisor. This is done by asking them to interact
                    with the app and then provide an evaluation and critcisms.

                    In this section of our testing we wrote our own code to test the validity
                    of our project code. We focused on testing the main functional modules in
                    our code. This includes specific functions (unit test) and larger classes
                    (integration test). Below is a list of the main modules we tested.

                    We implement our automated tests using the python standard unittest

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Manual Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    With manual testing we mainly focused on simply ensuring the UI and
                    to some extents the front-end was functional. There was no reason
                    to automate this as it would just be simply simulating a user progrimatically
                    which would just be unnescarry work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through our own testing of the general UI and also recreating edge-cases we concluded
                    that the front-end is primarily functional. The errors that we did find here have been
                    listed on the <a href="evaluation.html#bug-list">Evaluation</a> page of the website in 
                    the bug list.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Performance Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    For the actual performance of our app we had two main functionalities to test.
                    First the accuracy of our AI model, how long it takes to upload or retrieve a
                    tooth model to or from the server, and the time it takes to request a prediction
                    and recieve it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We trained our model on around 200 sextants of 3D tooth models. The model was
                    trained for 50 epochs with a learning rate of 0.01 and using the Adam optimiser.
                    The loss function used is Mean Squared Error. Below we have graphed the results.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img class="img-card" src="images/model-results.png" width="70%">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, gaining access to more tooth models is difficult due to the emphasis
                    on PLY files which are rare let alone available in public datasets of tooth models. 
                    However, the goal of this work is a proof-of-concept pipeline to show that with the 
                    given input we can return a result for tooth grading. In the future, optimisation 
                    will be very possible as more data will be gathered and the pipeline can be extended 
                    beyond simply tooth grading and broader treatment plan suggestions which is the 
                    overarching long-term goal of this project.

                    Overall it is obvious that the app could definetly be improved in terms
                    of the UI aspect. The theme should be slightly adjusted to be more neutral
                    and minimalist. Some functionalities need to be made more obvious by contrasting
                    more with the background and other elements. The loading speed when opening
                    3D models should be improved aswell but might not be possible.
