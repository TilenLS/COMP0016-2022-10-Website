            <h1>Week 8: Making ui adjustments and moving database to cloud (Mar 6 - Mar 12)</h1>
            <h2>Continue working on our project website</h2>
            <p>
                For this week, we continue to work on our project website, mainly on the implementation page, research page and 
                evaluation page. For the research page, we chose the important contents from our literature review and include 
                them into our website. The implementation page is more challenging as it requires more technical details. One of 
                the team members summarised all the details and include them in the implementation page. 
            </p>
            <h2>Moving database to cloud</h2>
            <p>
                Since one of the team members found a way to maintain the pre-trained deep-learning model on the Azure virtual 
                machine, we used a similar method to host our SQLite database on Azure. Python Requests library is used to send and 
                receive data between the client and the server. Besides, we decided to store the tooth model ply files as binary 
                file instead of storing file paths. It took us a few days to get the binary files displaying with Open3D. The main 
                challenge we faced is that some data is lost in the process of sending to the server, causing the tooth models to 
                be displayed in a wrong position. 
            </p>
            <h2>Change the theme of our software</h2>
            <p>
                After speaking to our TA, we are advised to change the theme of our software into light theme as it is more 
                suitable for a medical-related software and clinicians using the app for long will not strain their eyes. After 
                making the changes, our app looks like this:

            </div>
            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            <p>
                We are still waiting for more data from our client, the training of models will be continued by then. Besides, we 
                will have a code walkthrough with our client next week.
