            <h1>Week 3: Working on the user interface (Jan 23 - Jan 29)</h1>
            <h2>A more detailed architecture regarding the user interface</h2>
            <p>
                After discussion, we decided to have six pages of user interface in total. The six pages are login page, 
                registration page, home page (main page), add patient information page, tooth model viewing page and analysis 
                page. Each of us work on two to three pages and then meet up to merge the pages together with the database. The 
                overall flow of the user interface is as shown in the picture below:

            <h2>Discussion with project supervisor and teaching assistant about dataset issue</h2>
            <p>
                During our lab session this week, we discussed with Dr Yun Fu and our TA regarding the problem of dataset. Our 
                client intended to provide us data and tooth models of real patients, however, the ethical approval process of 
                using real patient data will take a very long amount of time. Hence, we are facing the problem of lack of dataset 
                to train a deep learning model that we already have. After discussion with our TA, we are suggested to consider 
                the option of machine learning and feature engineering since deep learning will not be feasible with such low 
                amount of data that we currently have. When talking to Dr Yun Fu, we are told that feature engineering and machine 
                learning might be very difficult for 3d models, we are suggested to change the project into analysing 2d tooth 
                images or x-ray tooth scans since we only have about six weeks’ time left to finish up our work. While we are very 
                surprised by this advice, Professor Dean appeared and told us that we could continue with what we are working on. 
                He is satisfied with our elevator pitch last week and we should continue to work on the software. The main goal 
                for this project should be to create a pipeline(software) that can take in 3d tooth models and view the tooth 
                models, as well as pass the 3d images into an AI model and provide some results regarding the tooth models. The 
                AI model doesn’t need to have high accuracy as this is just the first year of the project and we are building 
                everything from scratch. Finally, we come to a conclusion that we will continue to work on the user interface and 
                database of our software while waiting for our client’s response about how we should go on with the limited data.

            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            <p>
                Each team member will work on their respective pages of the user interface.
