            <h1>Week 7: Literature Review Pt 2 (Nov 21 - Nov 27)</h1>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p>
                    Continuing our literature review we had to consider some practical implications of the
                    research we were doing. The main one being that the complex AI architectures that we
                    found online have not been implemented in software and are not optimised. So although, they
                    have promising results it is unlikely we would be able to replicate the results within an app
                    (given the time frame for the project) and even if we could they would be too computationally
                    taxing for an everyday app. Hence the model would require extensive optimisation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we had to look into more practical and implementable solutions for algorithms we could
                    use for tooth grading. After some looking around at more general models we could tailor to tooth
                    wear grading we found PointNet. A robust neural-network architecture specifically made for
                    classification and segmentation of 3D point-cloud models. The general structure can bee seen below.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Due to its widespread popularity there was much previous open-source work we could look
                    towards for implementing a tooth grading algorithm. All we had to do was tailor it for
                    tooth wear analysis which was a far simpler task compared to recreating the highly
                    complex multi-model algorithm from most academic papers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another import issue to note is data gathering. It has been something we have struggled with
                    much as there are virtually no 3D PLY models of teeth online. Since this is a very new 
                    technology that hasn't been fully accepted yet. Most tooth scans are 2D and those which are
                    three dimensional are usally STL files which do not encode color. All we could do is liaise
                    with our client and hope he could provide us with some. Our client would now have to
                    produce these scans from prosthetic 'fake' teeth which would be costly and much time 
                    to would be needed for them to arrive. Alternatively get scans from real people, but
                    this requires long legal processes to even begin doing.
