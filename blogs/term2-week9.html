            <h1>Week 9: Finishing up project website and continue training of model (Mar 13 - Mar 19)</h1>
            <h2>Mostly done with the project website</h2>
            <p>
                Since there is not much time left for us, we work hard to finish up our project website this week. We mainly 
                focus on the appendix tab this week, writing up the user manual, deployment manual and legal section. We also 
                added a loading animation while refreshing the website. After speaking to the TA, we changed the way we present 
                our blogs so that it is more user friendly and easy to navigate between the blogs of different weeks.
            </p>
            <h2>Added more database related functionalities to our software</h2>
            <p>
                We realised that our app is lack of the functionality to display patients, hence we implemented it to our software 
                this week. The main challenged faced in implementing this functionality is that when a patient is deleted, the 
                position of the patients after him will be affected, causing some problems with deleting patients afterwards. We 
                managed to overcome this problem by using a list to store the patient id before and after the delete so that we 
                can easily find the position of the delete button of a specific patient in the table. We also realised that it 
                might be difficult for the clinician to find a specific patient in the table when there are a lot of patients 
                hence we implemented a search functionality in our app. 
            </p>
            <h2>Continue training deep learning model</h2>
            <p>
                Although we are still waiting for more data from our client, we found a way to generate more data from the existing 
                tooth models that we have received. Due to memory constraints, we are only able to pick around 2048 points from the 
                30000+ points of our 3D tooth models each time. Hence by randomly picking 2048 points from the same model for 10 
                times, we manage to get 10 times more data than what we initially had, and we are able to see improvements from 
                the trained modes. The accuracy for the training set can reach around 70%-80% of accuracy while the accuracy for 
                testing set can reach about 60%-70% of accuracy.
            </p>
            <h2>Code walkthrough with client</h2>
            <p>
                We scheduled a code walkthrough with our client, Dr Junaid Malik at his practice near UCL Bloomsbury campus. During 
                the code walkthrough, we updated him with our progress of the software and deep learning model. We also 
                demonstrated to him how to use our software. He gave us a few suggestions on how he think we could improve the 
                user interface. He was satisfied with our progress and suggested that we could get our work published as a 
                proof-of-concept project.
            </p>
            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            <p>
                The project is reaching an end very soon. Next week, we will mainly focus on testing our app, writing the 
                deployment manual, making some last minute fixes to the ui and recording the video for the second elevator pitch.
