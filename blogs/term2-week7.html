            <h1>Week 7: Started working on website and training models (Feb 27 - Mar 5)</h1>
            <h2>Started working on project website</h2>
            <p>
                Since there is only about three weeks left, we started to add contents to our project website. After discussion, 
                we agreed on the contents that we will include on our website and divided the work among team members. Our TA 
                suggested past project websites that are done well so we followed some of the styles of these websites. After 
                one week of work, the Home Page, Requirements Page, HCI Page and System Design Page is mostly completed. The home 
                page of our website looks like this for now:

            <h2>Training models for tooth wear evaluation</h2>
            <p>
                Our client gave us around 90 scans of sextants together with the labels. Hence, we can start to train our deep 
                learning model. We already have a network architecture for our model which is using PointNet for 3D classification 
                and segmentation. The model has been trained on 90 tooth models for 50 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001, using 
                the Adam optimizer. Due to low amount of data, the accuracy obtained is quite low at about 20%-30%. We will 
                continue to modify our deep learning model and our client also promise to provide us more data in the next 
                two weeks. Hopefully by then the accuracy of our model will be improved. We choose to maintain the pre-trained 
                model on the Azure virtual machine.
            </p>
            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            <p>
                We will continue to train our deep learning model upon receiving more data from the client. Besides, we will focus 
                on editing and decorating our website.
