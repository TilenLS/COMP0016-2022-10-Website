            <h1>Week 8: Literature Review Pt 3 (Nov 28 - Dec 4)</h1>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p>
                    Now that we had covered the base part of the algortihm, grading tooth wear,
                    this had to be incorporated to a parent algorithm that would use those results
                    to provide clinical decision support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After reviewing several papers on Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), some
                    specific to dentsitry and others more general we had a good overview of how they
                    can be structured.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img class="img-card" src="images/CDSS.png" width="70%">
                </div>
                <p>
                    One obvious solution would be to use another neural network that takes the tooth wear
                    grades and patient data as input and suggests treatment plans. Given enough training
                    data this would potentially provide very accurate results. However, this again
                    would require our client to produce data of tooth scans of real patients with their
                    personal and medical backgrounds, along with the corresponding dentist recommended
                    treatment plans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though this has been included in our research it will not be included within
                    the development of the project due to time constraints. This will likely be done
                    by later generations who get handed down this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An interesting side note. Another similar proposal for a CDSS is to use a neuro-fuzzy
                    system. This combines the human reasoning of fuzzy logic with the human learning aspect
                    of neural networks. There are few examples of this approach having been used to implement
                    CDSS with very promising results. However, this is primarily academic work and very hard
                    to realistically implement.
