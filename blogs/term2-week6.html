            <h1>Week 6: Adding more functionalites to the current application (Feb 20 - Feb 26)</h1>
            <h2>Add more functionality to software</h2>
            <p>
                The main structure of our software is completed, hence we started adding more functionalities to it. We added a 
                functionality which is when the user press on the patient’s ID button, the viewing page will open with the tooth 
                model of the corresponding patient showing. It’s been a tough time implementing this functionality. The first 
                challenge we met is to create buttons in the home page and pass the patient’s id as a parameter into the button 
                clicked function. At last, we manage to do it by adding a for loop in the UI_Homepage.py and create buttons and 
                link buttons with its clicked function in the for loop. The second challenge we faced is the 3d image in the 
                viewing page became very small when buttons are clicked multiple times. We fix this bug by passing the image viewer 
                object as a parameter into the UI_Homepage class and the button clicked function.

            <h2>Making the user interface of login and register page responsive</h2>
            <p>
                Besides adding additional functionalities, we are also working on making the user interface of the login and 
                register page responsive, so that the size of the widgets and components change accordingly when the size of the 
                window is changed.

            <h2>Giving up on hosting the database on Microsoft Azure</h2>
            <p>
                After doing a lot of research and looking for documentation about hosting sqlite3 database on Microsoft Azure, we 
                decided that we will not be hosting our database on Microsoft Azure because it is too difficult. One of the team 
                members tried to recreate the sqlite3 database and move it to Microsoft Azure in his own isolated environment but 
                he fails to do so. There isn’t much information about hosting sqlite3 database online as sqlite3 is a serverless 
                database engine. The reason we choose to use sqlite3 in the first place is because it is ideal for prototype 
                applications of small and medium size, sqlite3 is flexible and easy to implement.
            </p>
            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            <p>
                Our client hasn’t provide us with the data yet, hence the focus of next week will be working on our project 
                website.
