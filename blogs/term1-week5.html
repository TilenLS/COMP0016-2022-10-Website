            <h1>Week 5: Sketching & Prototypes (Oct 10 - Oct 16)</h1>
            <p>
                Now that we had a good understanding of what we are making, why we are making it, and who we are making for we continued to the next part of the process which is sketching potential designs for the software. We decided to make our wireframes using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Sketches</h2>
            <p>
                We decided on two different designs for the two main pages: the welcome screen and the workspace. We decided to leave a more indepth sketch of other potential pages to a second iteration when had a better idea of the overall design pattern for the main pages that would dictate the design.
            </p>
            <div class="image-grid">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col"><img src="../images/Sketches/Sketch 1 Welcome Screen.png"></div>
                    <div class="col"><img src="../images/Sketches/Sketch 1 Workspace.png"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col"><img src="../images/Sketches/Sketch 2 Welcome.png"></div>
                    <div class="col"><img src="../images/Sketches/Sketch 2 Workspace.png"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                After making these sketches we decided we like welcome screen #1 and workspace #1 were the most straightforward and simple to understand. We also asked our client what they preferred and they agreed that those sketches were most coherent and user-friendly. This led us to create our second, more in depth sketches:

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col"><img src="../images/Sketches/Welcome screen.png"></div>
                    <div class="col"><img src="../images/Sketches/Patient input screen.png"></div>
                </div>

                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-3"></div>
                    <div class="col align-self-center"><img src="../images/Sketches/Result screen.png"></div>
                    <div class="col-3"></div>

            <h2>Prototype</h2>
            <p>
                Now that we have completed our sketches and we had a good idea of the general design for the software we went ahead with making a low-fidelity prototype. With this we were able to display some of the functionalities the software might have.
            </p>
            <div class="image-grid">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col"><img src="../images/Prototypes/PrototypeSlide1.png"></div>
                    <div class="col"><img src="../images/Prototypes/PrototypeSlide2.png"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col"><img src="../images/Prototypes/PrototypeSlide3.png"></div>
                    <div class="col"><img src="../images/Prototypes/PrototypeSlide4.png"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-3"></div>
                    <div class="col align-self-center"><img src="../images/Prototypes/PrototypeSlide5.png"></div>
                    <div class="col-3"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>Prototype Evaluation</h2>
            <p>
                We had to evaluate the prototype next and we decided on a heuristics evaluation based on insight from showing the first prototype and our individual reviews. We evaluated our prototype based on the following 5 heuristics:
            </p>
            <img class="blog-img" src="../images/HeuristicEvaluation.png">
            <p>
                Now that we have evaluated the initial iteration of the prototype and learned that in regards to visbility, aesthetic, and recognition our prototype was lacking. For the second iteration we decided to focus more on making the prototype be a more user-friendly environment that less confusion prone.
            </p>
            <div class="image-grid">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col"><img src="../images/Prototypes/ImprovedPrototype1.png"></div>
                    <div class="col"><img src="../images/Prototypes/ImprovedPrototype2.png"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">

            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            <p>
                Having completed the sketches and low-fidelity prototype we could finally begin with an indepth literature review. This will mainly focus on databases of tooth models, pre-exisitng software for STL and PLY file format viewing, and deep learning models realted to tooth model analysis.
