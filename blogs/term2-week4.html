            <h1>Week 4: In person meeting with client to discuss about project details (Jan 30 - Feb 5)</h1>
            <h2>Log in page and register page completed and connected to database</h2>
            <p>
                One of the team members completed the log in page and register page that allows user to register before logging in. 
                The reason of having these two extra pages is because after talking to the client, he wishes the software can allow 
                different dentists (users) to sign in and only authorised users will be able to log in and view the tooth models 
                and patient information.
            </p>
            <h2>In person meeting with client to discuss about the project</h2>
            <p>
                On Thursday, we meet up with our client for lunch and discuss about the project details during the meal. Our 
                client told us that this project is his PHD project, and he didn’t expect it to be so difficult to implement at 
                first. We explained to our client about our current progress and told him that our biggest challenge and blocker 
                for now is lack of data. After reading the research papers, we feel that at least 1000 data or above can provide good 
                accuracy for the deep learning model. Currently, we only have 14 data bought by our client. Our client told us that 
                he is still waiting for the ethical approval, and he is afraid that it might take a longer period to get the 
                approval because this is considered as a high-risk project. The client then come up with a solution which 
                is he will buy tooth models online from Brazil and make wear on these tooth models himself. He will scan all these 
                tooth models to us by the end of February and it is estimated that we can get around 200 to 300 data. Due to time 
                constraint, instead of working on analysing the whole teeth, we only analyse one sextant of the teeth which consists 
                of only four teeth. This makes it easier for our client to scan the tooth models and for us to train the deep 
                learning model because there are only four teeth to be considered. Although 200 to 300 is not a lot as compared 
                to the 1000, we are confident that this amount of data should at least be able to provide certain level of 
                accuracy. Before leaving, we also recommended some courses about deep learning and machine learning to our client 
                as he wishes to learn more about this field which will also help him in writing his thesis.
            </p>
            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            <p>
                Since the client will only be able to provide us more data in a few weeks’ time, our focus for now is still 
                the software. Each team member will continue to work on their part of the user interface.
