            <h1>Week 9: Literature review continued (Dec 5 - Dec 11)</h1>
            <p>
                This week, we continue to do more research on our project, especially regarding the AI model because 
                our client mentioned that he would like to have a face-to-face meeting next week and wish to learn about 
                the structure and algorithms of our project. We read a paper about a highly accurate three-dimensional (3D) 
                superimposition technique has been suggested recently for occlusal tooth wear assessment. The paper concludes 
                that using the complete crown as reference area, with reduced estimated overlap of meshes to 20%, provide the most 
                accurate outcome when calculating the volume loss of tooth structure. This paper mentions a software call 
                WearCompare which is an application that can calculate volume loss of tooth structure by inputting two tooth scans 
                taken at different time points.
            </p>
            <h2>WearCompare</h2>
            <p>
                Wear Compare, developed by University of Leeds, is a purpose-built surface matching freeware designed for dental 
                applications. It can be used for quantifying tooth wear progression as it outputs the volume loss of tooth structure 
                when the user inputs two tooth scans of the same patient taken at different point of time. The underlying software 
                registration algorithm of this application includes feature based global registration coupled with a custom 
                iteratively refined version of the Iterative Closest Point algorithm. This app is part of our technology review, it 
                is the first app we found that is designed specifically for tooth wear purposes. The advantage of this app is that 
                it is free for usage and provides accurate results when quantifying tooth wear progression. The drawback of this 
                app is its functionally is quite limited. 
            </p>
            <h2>WearCompare vs the app we want to develop</h2>
            <p>
                The app that we are going to develop will focus more on using machine learning or deep learning to calculate 
                tooth wear degree. Instead of having the percentage of tooth loss being outputted, we aim to output the tooth wear 
                grade, totalling of 5 grades. Besides, users of WearCompare is expected to provide tooth scans of the same patient 
                in different time points. For the app that we are going to develop, users just need to input the current tooth scan 
                of patient and the tooth wear grade of patient will be displayed. Besides, our app aim to provide more 
                functionalities such as analysing the cause of tooth wear (mechanical tooth wear, chemical tooth wear and 
                pathological tooth wear).
            </p>
            <h2>Streamlit</h2>
            <p>
                We found a powerful open-source Python library, Streamlit that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, 
                custom web apps for machine learning and data science. This library provides an easy way to display the results 
                of our AI model. However, it is used to build web application instead of Windows-based application. We plan to ask 
                our clients preference before deciding on the frontend library we are going to use for our application.
            </p>
            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            <p>
            We will further discuss the details of our project when we have a meeting with our client. By then, we will decide on 
            the specific libraries and programming languages to be used in our project. We will finish our literature review by the 
            end of next week and record the video of our literature review.
