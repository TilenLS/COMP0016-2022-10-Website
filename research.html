                <p>
                    Doing research for this project was extremely crucial as we were
                    not building on top of previous work. This had to be done from scratch
                    and related work is sparse. Especially when in the context of industry,
                    most work that has been is purely academic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to this academic nature of the project, we had to first familiarise
                    ourselves with concrete work that has been done in the field. Including
                    Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), 3D tooth models, tooth wear
                    indices, and tooth grading algorithms.

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Clinical Decision Support System</h3>
                <p>
                    Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are systems intended to
                    improve healthcare delivery by enhancing medical decision-making
                    capabilities with targeted clinical knowledge, patient information,
                    and other health information. It is key here to note that the ultimate
                    goal is to assist clinicians in their work and not replace it.

                <h3 class="section-subheading">3D Tooth Models</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the core goals of this project is to ensure that it works
                    with 3D tooth models. The reason for this is due to the greater
                    detail in 3D models as opposed to 2D scan has greater potential
                    for more accurate analysis of tooth wear. This is primarily through
                    analysis of the volumetric loss of the teeth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most common file format for such 3D models is STL which is most
                    commonly used for 3D printing. A less common format is PLY that is
                    very similar to STL, but also perserves the color of the model.
                    This is useful as discoloration is often a key indicator of the
                    severity of tooth wear.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Tooth Wear Indices</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to convert tooth wear analysis into tangible and useable
                    information we had to use Tooth Wear Indices as a basis for any
                    algorithms that will provide clinicians with suggestions. Fortunately,
                    there has been plenty of work done within this field. Below are the
                    three most prominant indices.

                    After considering all the literature we had read, we were uncertain
                    and decided to ask our client whose medical knowledge and experience
                    would be helpful. After discussing with our client, we concluded that
                    TWES 2.0 would be the best option. This is because it provides 5 simple
                    answers but the classification by which a degree of tooth wear is placed
                    into a specific level is very robust.

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Tooth Grading Algorithm</h3>
                <p>
                    The main algorithms that have been used in academic work for tooth wear
                    grading are classification and segmentation. Then followed by the actual
                    grading algorithm. There are various approaches and different models
                    to achieve this but most first classify the various kind of teeth
                    and then segment them. Once the individual tooth has been isolated, it can
                    be graded through any ML or AI based method that considers volumetric loss
                    and discoloration.
                </p>
                <div class="image-grid">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col"><img src="images/3D-segmentation.png"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    However, the issue with such algorithms is that they are very specialised
                    particularly for 3D tooth models. They are not open source and optimised
                    for industrial use yet. Therefore, we had to settle for a more general
                    purpose architecture and trade off some accuracy for effiency. One such
                    model that is well known is the PointNet network.

                    After understanding the academic background of the project the next step 
                    was to explore previous work that was done. From this we would be able
                    to better understand what tools to use to realise the project. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Previous Work</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout our search we found only three somewhat similar implementations.
                    The first and most thorough is Pearl AI. It works with 2D x-ray scans and is
                    capable of segmenting individual tooth for the detection of pathological features.
                    Unfortunately, this wasn't of much use as the goal of our project is to remain
                    in the 3D realm to take advantage of the increased detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second application is WearCompare. It intakes 3D scans of the same teeth
                    over different time points and has the clinician manually select the 
                    surfaces to compare. Then it quantifies tooth wear progression. Although this
                    uses 3D tooth models, it requires too much manual interaction and multiple scans.
                    Our project has to be as automatic as possible using Artificial Intelligence 
                    to assist clinicians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly is OrthoAid. It provides dentists with enhanced tools for analysing 3D
                    tooth models before and after operative dental study models. Similarly to the
                    previous example, it uses 3D models but does not include any or very little
                    automation on an AI basis. Furthermore, this app was very technical and
                    difficult to use.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Languages & Libraries</h3>
                <p>
                    The first key factor to consider here was that the app needed to be built
                    for windows. After considering the 3D aspect of the project we thought a
                    language such as C# or C++ would be best suited. However, due to the
                    uncommon use of the PLY file format after attempting to recreate the
                    model rendering code of the above examples we could make it work for STL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we decided to switch to Python and find a library that can render
                    both STL and PLY file formats. This is because the algorithm would be written
                    in Python so having everything being done in one language was convenient.
                    Although there are many libraries for rendering such 3D models, few provide
                    GUI integration. After much testing we found the best option was the Open3D
                    library that could be easily used in our app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for the GUI, at first we went towards PyQt6. This is the most common and
                    versatile Python GUI available. However, there are licensing issues with
                    this library as it is under a GPL commercial license. Instead we chose
                    PySide2 which is essentially identical to PyQt6 but is under a LGPL license
                    so we would have no issues using the library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For data storage we decided to use SQLite to deploy a local database at first.
                    This is because a remote database was not a high priority in our MoSCoW agreement.
                    If development went smoothly we would deploy a remote database using Azure later
                    on.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Algorithms</h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in the Project Review section on this page we decided on using the
                    TWES 2.0 grading system for the general overal algorithm strucutre. This includes
                    two sections. First the tooth wear screening phase where patient data such as age,
                    alcohol consumption, etc is gathered along with their tooth scans. Then the tooth
                    wear status phase. This is where the teeth are graded using the previously mentioned
                    PointNet network using PyTorch to grade the teeth. This is done by grading each sextant (1/6
                    <sup>th</sup> of the teeth) first by grading their respective individual teeth. Then
                    based on the sextant graded an overall score is given to the wear present within the 
                    teeth. After these results are calculated, they are used along with the patient data
                    gathered during the first stage to suggest a treatment plan.
