                <p>
                    Doing research for this project was extremely crucial as we were
                    not building on top of previous work. This had to be done from scratch
                    and related work is sparse. Especially when in the context of industry,
                    most work that has been is purely academic.

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Clinical Decision Support System</h3>
                <p>
                    Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are systems intended to
                    improve healthcare delivery by enhancing medical decision-making
                    capabilities with targeted clinical knowledge, patient information,
                    and other health information. Below is the general structure of such 
                    a system. It is key here to note that the ultimate goal is to assist 
                    clinicians in their work and not replace it.
                    <sup>1</sup>

                </div>
                <p>
                    There are also different kinds of CDSS that use different methods to
                    provide support to clinicians. A few can be seen below.

                <h3 class="section-subheading">3D Tooth Models</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the core goals of this project is to ensure that it works
                    with 3D tooth models. The reason for this is due to the greater
                    detail in 3D models as opposed to 2D scans which has greater potential
                    for more accurate analysis of tooth wear through volumetric loss and
                    structural irregularity.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img class="img-card" src="images/ToothModel.jpg" width="70%"></img>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The most common file format for such 3D models is STL which is most
                    commonly used for 3D printing. A less common format is PLY that is
                    very similar to STL, but also perserves the color of the model.
                    This is useful as discoloration is often a key indicator of the
                    severity of tooth wear.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Tooth Wear Indices</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to convert tooth wear analysis into tangible and useable
                    information we had to use Tooth Wear Indices as a basis for any
                    algorithms that will provide clinicians with suggestions. Fortunately,
                    there has been plenty of work done within this field. Below are the
                    three most prominant indices.

                    After considering all the literature we had read, we were uncertain
                    and decided to ask our client whose medical knowledge and experience
                    would be helpful. After discussing with our client, we concluded that
                    TWES 2.0 would be the best option. This is because it provides 5 simple
                    answers but the classification by which a degree of tooth wear is placed
                    into a specific level is very robust.

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Tooth Grading Algorithm</h3>
                <p>
                    The main algorithms that have been used in academic work for tooth wear
                    grading are classification and segmentation. Then followed by the actual
                    grading algorithm. There are various approaches and different models
                    to achieve this but most first classify the various kind of teeth
                    and then segment them. Once the individual tooth has been isolated, it can
                    be graded through any ML or AI based method that considers volumetric loss
                    and discoloration.
                </p>
                <div class="image-grid">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col"><img src="images/3D-segmentation.png"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-3"></div>
                        <div class="col  align-self-center"><img src="images/SegmentedTeeth.png"></div>
                        <div class="col-3"></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    However, the issue with such algorithms is that they are very specialised
                    particularly for 3D tooth models. They are not open source and optimised
                    for industrial use yet. Therefore, we had to settle for a more general
                    purpose architecture and trade off some accuracy for effiency. One such
                    model that is well known is the PointNet network. Its general structure
                    is depicted below.

                    After understanding the academic background of the project the next step
                    was to explore previous work that was done. From this we would be able
                    to better understand what tools to use to realise the project.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Previous Work</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout our search we found only three somewhat similar implementations.
                    The first and most thorough is <a href="https://www.hellopearl.com/">Pearl AI</a>.
                    It works with 2D x-ray scans and is capable of segmenting individual tooth for
                    the detection of pathological features. Unfortunately, this wasn't of much use
                    as the goal of our project is to remain in the 3D realm to take advantage of
                    the increased detail.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img class="img-card" src="images/PearlAIdemo.jpg" width="70%">
                </div>  
                <p>
                    The second application is <a href="https://leedsdigitaldentistry.com/wearcompare/">
                    WearCompare</a>. It intakes 3D scans of the same teeth over different time points
                    and has the clinician manually select the surfaces to compare. Then it quantifies
                    tooth wear progression. Although this uses 3D tooth models, it requires too much
                    manual interaction and multiple scans. Our project has to be as automatic as possible
                    using Artificial Intelligence to assist clinicians.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img class="img-card" src="images/WearCompare.png" width="70%">
                </div>  
                <p>
                    Lastly is <a href="https://github.com/amir-abdi/OrthoAid">OrthoAid</a>. It provides
                    dentists with enhanced tools for analysing 3D tooth models before and after operative
                    dental study models. Similarly to the previous example, it uses 3D models but does
                    not include any or very little automation on an AI basis. Furthermore, this app was
                    very technical and difficult to use.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img class="img-card" src="images/OrthoAidUserInterface.jpeg" width="70%">
                </div>  
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Languages & Libraries</h3>
                <p>
                    At first we decided to attempt creating the app with C# or C++
                    as our app had to be built for Windows and dealt with 3D models.
                    We tried implementing some of the code for the OrthoAid app to render
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we decided to switch to Python and find a library that can render
                    both STL and PLY file formats. This was convenient as the algorithmic part
                    of the app would also be written in Python. We decided on using Open3D for
                    rendering PLY files as we found some previous examples on its integration with
                    GUIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for the GUI, at first we thought of PyQt6. However, there are licensing issues 
                    with this library as it is under a GPL commercial license. Hence we chose
                    PySide2 which is identical to PyQt6 but is under a LGPL license so we could use
                    it without facing issues in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For data storage we decided to use SQLite to deploy a local database at first.
                    This is because a remote database was not a high priority in our MoSCoW agreement.
                    If development went smoothly we would deploy a remote database using Azure later
                    on.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Algorithms</h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in the Project Review section on this page we decided on using the
                    TWES 2.0 grading system for the general overal algorithm strucutre. This includes
                    two sections. First the tooth wear screening phase where patient data such as age,
                    alcohol consumption, etc is gathered along with their tooth scans. Then the tooth
                    wear status phase. This is where the teeth are graded using the previously mentioned
                    PointNet network implementedusing PyTorch to grade the teeth. 
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img class="img-card" src="images/ProjectOverview.jpg" width="70%">
                </div>
                <p>
                    This is done by grading each sextant (1/6<sup>th</sup> of the teeth) first by grading 
                    their respective individual teeth. Then based on the sextant graded an overall score 
                    is given to the wear present within the teeth. After these results are calculated, 
                    they are used along with the patient data gathered during the first stage to suggest 
                    a treatment plan.
