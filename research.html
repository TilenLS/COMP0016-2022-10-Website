                    Doing research for this project was extremely crucial as we were
                    not building on top of previous work. This had to be done from scratch
                    and related work is sparse. Especially when in the context of industry,
                    most work that has been is purely academic.

                                Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are systems intended to
                                improve healthcare delivery by enhancing medical decision-making
                                capabilities with targeted clinical knowledge, patient information,
                                and other health information. Below is the general structure of such
                                a system. It is key here to note that the ultimate goal is to assist
                                clinicians in their work and not replace it.

                                    There are also different kinds of CDSS that use different methods to
                                    provide support to clinicians. A few can be seen below.<sup>1</sup>

                    After understanding the academic background of the project the next step
                    was to explore previous work that was done. From this we would be able
                    to better understand what tools to use to realise the project.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Previous Work</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout our search we found only three somewhat similar implementations.
                    The first and most thorough is <a href="https://www.hellopearl.com/">Pearl AI</a>.
                    It works with 2D x-ray scans and is capable of segmenting individual tooth for
                    the detection of pathological features. Unfortunately, this wasn't of much use
                    as the goal of our project is to remain in the 3D realm to take advantage of
                    the increased detail.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img class="img-card" src="images/PearlAIdemo.jpg" width="50%">
                </div>
                <p>
                    The second application is <a href="https://leedsdigitaldentistry.com/wearcompare/">
                        WearCompare</a>. It intakes 3D scans of the same teeth over different time points
                    and has the clinician manually select the surfaces to compare. Then it quantifies
                    tooth wear progression. Although this uses 3D tooth models, it requires too much
                    manual interaction and multiple scans. Our project has to be as automatic as possible
                    using Artificial Intelligence to assist clinicians.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img class="img-card" src="images/WearCompare.png" width="50%">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Lastly is <a href="https://github.com/amir-abdi/OrthoAid">OrthoAid</a>. It provides
                    dentists with enhanced tools for analysing 3D tooth models before and after operative
                    dental study models. Similarly to the previous example, it uses 3D models but does
                    not include any or very little automation on an AI basis. Furthermore, this app was
                    very technical and difficult to use.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img class="img-card" src="images/OrthoAidUserInterface.jpeg" width="50%">
                </div>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Languages & Libraries</h3>
                <p>
                    At first we decided to attempt creating the app with C# or C++
                    as our app had to be built for Windows and dealt with 3D models.
                    We tried implementing some of the code for the OrthoAid app to render
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we decided to switch to Python and find a library that can render
                    both STL and PLY file formats. This was convenient as the algorithmic part
                    of the app would also be written in Python. We decided on using Open3D for
                    rendering PLY files as we found some previous examples on its integration with
                    GUIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for the GUI, at first we thought of PyQt6. However, there are licensing issues
                    with this library as it is under a GPL commercial license. Hence we chose
                    PySide2 which is identical to PyQt6 but is under a LGPL license so we could use
                    it without facing issues in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For data storage we decided to use SQLite to deploy a local database initially.
                    This is because a remote database was not a high priority in our MoSCoW agreement.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Algorithms</h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in the Project Research section on this page we decided on using the
                    TWES 2.0 grading system for the general overal algorithm strucutre. This includes
                    two sections. First the tooth wear screening phase where patient data such as age,
                    alcohol consumption, etc is gathered along with their tooth scans. Then the tooth
                    wear status phase. This is where the teeth are graded using the previously mentioned
                    PointNet network implementedusing PyTorch to grade the teeth.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img class="img-card" src="images/ProjectOverview.jpg" width="70%">
                </div>
                <p>
                    This is done by grading each sextant (1/6<sup>th</sup> of the teeth) first by grading
                    their respective individual teeth. Then based on the sextant graded an overall score
                    is given to the wear present within the teeth. After these results are calculated,
                    they are used along with the patient data gathered during the first stage to suggest
                    a treatment plan.
