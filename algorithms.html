                    We went through a vast amount of literature on numerically evaluating tooth wear using machine
                    learning (ML) and Deep learning (DL) on 3D point cloud. Due to the special nature of point cloud
                    data, using traditional ML algorithms is not suitable in this project as we need do extract features
                    from the point cloud dataset. However, because of the ethical issues present when dealing with
                    patient data, it is difficult to obtain a large amount of real patient data with well labeled
                    features.
                    The computer vision algorithm in the point cloud field that we use is the PointNet network. We will
                    explain the details of the algorithm in the following sections.

    <section id="Dataset">
        <div class="container-fluid section-intro">
            <h1 class="section-heading">Dataset</h1>
            <h3>Data Source</h3>
            <p>
                The data we used is from our client, the UCL Eastman Dental Institute. They provided us with 127 3D
                teeth models (sextants). They also provides us with 14 real patient teeth  models to be displayed in 
                the windows software.
                <br> <br>
                Originally, we were supposed to train the deep learning model on real patient data. However, due to the
                ethical issues, we did not recieve the dataset until March 2022. Therefore, we agreed to build a 
                proof-of-concept model using the sextant tooth models, where a sextant is 1/6<sup>th</sup> of the whole
                teeth (contains 5 or 6 teeth). We recieved a dataset of 127 3D teeth models on the 13th of March, 67 more 
                on the 23rd of March and we started to train and improve our model since then.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Description</h3>
            <p>
                The data we received is in the PLY format, which is an uncommon format for storing 3D point cloud 
                data. Each tooth model is labeled with a tooth wear grade from 0 to 4 on each tooth manually by 
                experienced dentists. Hence, the label for a tooth model is consists of 4 grades. According to the 
                TWES2.0 standard, mentioned in the <a href="research.html">Research Section</a>, the overall tooth
                wear grade depends on the highest grade among the 4 teeth.
            </p>
            <p>
                The distribution of the tooth model dataset is shown in the following pie chart.

            <h3>Data augmentation</h3>
            <p>
                As we only received 194 tooth models, we decided to use data augmentation to increase 
                the size of the dataset as 194 is not a sufficient amount of data for training a deep 
                learning model.
            </p>
            <h3>Training and Testing dataset</h3>
            <p>
                Ratio of training and testing datasets: 80% training, 20% testing
            </p>
            <p>
                We decided to split the dataset into 80% for training and 20% for testing. In order to have a 
                more accurate score, we used K-fold cross validation to train the model. We chose to use 
                K = 5, which means we split the dataset into 5 parts randomly, and each time we use 4 parts 
                for training and 1 part for testing. We repeat this process 5 times and get the average score.

                    We used PointNet network to process the input data. This structure is able to overcome
                    permutation invariance (unordered) and transformation invariance, which are two 
                    important properties of point cloud data. It is easy to imagine that the result should no
