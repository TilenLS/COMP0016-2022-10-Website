                This is a project with Junaid Saleem Malik of the UCL Eastman Dental Institute.
                We were presented with the utility of clinical decision support systems to provide
                systematic and unified decision-making for treating dental disease. This has been explored
                and implemented quite widely within the field of prosthodontics. However, this technology
                has yet to break into the prosthodontic management of tooth wear due to the number of varying 
                treatment approaches present. There are even several indeces to grade tooth wear.
