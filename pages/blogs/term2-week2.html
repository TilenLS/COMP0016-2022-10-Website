            <h1>Week 2: Preparation for elevator pitch (Jan 16 - Jan 22)</h1>
            <h2>Elevator pitch slides</h2>
            <p>
                Our slides consist of three content pages, which includes the overview of our project, the system architecture and 
                structure of our project, current progress, and deliverables. We spend most of the time modifying the overview page 
                because there is a lot of information that we feel important, and we would like to include them into our slides. 
                However, due to the two-minute time constraint, we deleted a lot of content and only keep the parts that we feel 
                are extremely relevant. On Thursday night, we were advised to not include more than three sentences in each slide, 
                hence we did a last minute change on our slides especially for the overview page. We reduced unnecessary long 
                sentences and use bullet point instead.
            </p>
            <h2>System architecture and structure</h2>
            <p>
                As we already have an idea about the structure for the user interface, image viewer tools and artificial intelligence model, 
                we created a chart for the system architecture of our project using lucid chart. We use PySide2 and Open3d for the 
                frontend, whereas the backend uses Sqlite3 to store patient data. Pytorch is used to implement deep learning models 
                on classification. The picture below is the chart for the system architecture and structure:

            <h2>Script preparation, video recording and rehearsal</h2>
            <p>
                After completing the slides, we started writing the scripts. We decided that everyone in the team should present. 
                After a few days of script writing and modifying, we were satisfied with what we had and started rehearsing for the 
                real presentation on Friday. For the pre-recorded video of this presentation, we decided to record separately 
                before stitching them together as one to provide more flexibility. 
            </p>
            <h2>Live elevator pitch</h2>
            <p>
                Since the elevator pitch is carried out online, we booked a room to do the live presentation. The elevator pitch 
                went well, and our client are satisfied with our presentation.
            </p>
            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            <p>
                The elevator pitch is finally over, we will continue to work on the application and deep learning model.
