            <h1>Week 3: Introductions & Requirement gathering (Sep 26 - Oct 2)</h1>
            <p>
                Starting the this week we had been introduced to our respective team members and received the client brief. We decided to use Microsoft Teams as our main form of communication for meetings between team members and client. We also chose to use Whatsapp for more streamlined and readily available communication, with the permission of the client.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first team meeting was straightforward; getting know each other and brain storming about the project. Since there are only 3 members it did not take long to get familiar and comfortable working with each other and around our strengths. We began gathering information on the field of study our project was baed on, dentistry, as it was completely new to us.
            </p>
            <h2>Client brief</h2>
            <p>
                Our first meeting with the client would take place later the following week as we had to spend some time liaising an available time slot for everyone due to the busy schedule of our client. In the meantime, we had already received the client brief:

                    Within prosthodontics, clinical decision support systems can be utilised to try and develop a systematic and unified approach to decision-making for treating dental disease. A particular area that is subject to significant variation is the prosthodontic management of tooth wear due to the number of treatment approaches and philosophies present.
                    The use of clinical indices for the purposes of screening for oral disease has been routinely used within dentistry. Several indices have been proposed to grade the severity of tooth wear by recording the surface characteristics of teeth and providing a numerical score.
                    We would firstly aim to build a first-generation proof-of-concept Win32 native windows application, that can take in 3D geometric image files (STL datasets), and build a robust set of tools in this windows app to enable dentists to add metatag information and annotate the 3D shapes (with highlighters and different colours) on the images to help map a corpus of tagged images that have well labelled severity of tooth wear. Categories of conditions will be provided as a text document to enable limited tag choices (not free flowing text).
                    We will expand to the development of a clinical decision support system that will support clinicians with a unified and systematic presentation of treatment-related data. In short this will become an engine for future 3D teeth image databases to label and add information to associate onto the models, in turn leading to machine learning approaches that when subsequent teeth models are scanned in, ML results can choose from the tag choices for which ones have confidence.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Build a Windows 32 app to take in those 3D model (STL) images, annotate and tag the images with keywords from a limited tags list, dental notes and highlighted geometry of various colours.</li>
                    <li>Build with APIs to existing ML imaging models to seek and auto highlight similar artefacts</li>
                    <li>Store the model and fileset (STL plus annotations and highlights should lead to a open source file format specification, e.g. in XML or JSON)</li>
                    <li>Be able to replicate with other image sets</li>
                    <li>Report on the accuracy and performance based on actual clinician's feedback on the detection. It should further enable other types of conditions to use this engine and provide early ML training.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            <p>
                We began gathering requirements by understanding what our client would need based on the information in the brief. With this we began gathering data and doing research on 3D modelling software, potential public data sets of tooth models, previous work on machine learning and deep learning within dentistry.
