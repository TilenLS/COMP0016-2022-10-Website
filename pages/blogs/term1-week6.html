            <h1>Week 6: Literature Review (Nov 14 - NOv 20))</h1>
            <p>
                After finishing the HCI report, we finally begin with an in depth literature review on tooth wear clinical decision support system. The literature review was mainly focused on three parts --
                <ol>
                    <li>Background of tooth wear </li>
                    <li>Tech stack for a Windows app </li>
                    <li>Deep learning architectures on 3D models </li>
                </ol> 
                <br>This week, we arranged a meeting with our client to gather more influential papers in the tooth wear field. After the meeting, we received 9 papers, ranging from how tooth wear is diagnosed in the clinic to the current application of deep learning on 2D tooth wear images.
            </p>  
            <p>
                <i>I will update the literature review process on these three parts simultaneously in the following three weeks.</i>
            </p>
            <h2>Background of tooth wear</h2>
            <p>
                Tooth wear is a multifactorial condition, leading to the loss of dental hard tissues. When the condition progresses, it can become pathologi- cal, and several signs and symptoms may occur. Our research on tooth wear was mainly based on the paper Diagnosing tooth wear, a new taxonomy based on the revised version of the Tooth Wear Evaluation System (TWES 2.0) which introduced an evaluation system on grading the severeness of tooth wear and determining a proper treatment decision. In order to detect increased levels of tooth wear at an early stage to avoid necessary costly treatments, a broadly applicable Tooth Wear Evaluation System is crucial at this stage. 

                <br>Tooth wear severeness can be broken down into 5 grades, from 0 to 4. The grading task is divided into two stages, tooth wear screening and tooth wear status. 
            </p>
            <h3>Tooth Wear Screeening</h3>
            <p>
                The aim of this examination is to identify patients with prominent findings who need to undergo a more detailed examination quickly. Here are two grading scales used to identify the severeness of patient teeth on occlusal & incisal and non-occlusal & non-incisal.
            </p>
            <div class="image-grid">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col"><img src="../../images/Week6/occlusal_grading.png"></div>
                    <div class="col"><img src="../../images/Week6/non-icclusal_grading.png"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                The aim of this examination is to identify patients with prominent findings who need to undergo a more detailed examination quickly. Here are two grading scales used to identify the severeness of patient teeth on occlusal & incisal and non-occlusal & non-incisal. The highest grade for each sextant is entered in a documentation form. 
            </p>
            <div class="image-grid">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col"><img src="../../images/Week6/sextant.jpeg"></div>
                    <div class="col"><img src="../../images/Week6/form.png"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                The indication for a more detailed Tooth Wear Status depends on the highest individual grades, according to the following rules:
                <ul>
                    <li>Grade 0 in all sextants and the anterior palatal sextant → No tooth wear → No action required </li>
                    <li>Grade 1 in any or all sextants and/or the anterior palatal sextant → Mild tooth wear → No action required </li>
                    <li>Grade 2 in any or all sextants and/or the anterior palatal sextant → Moderate tooth wear → Detailed Tooth Wear Status can be performed </li>
                    <li>Grade 3 or 4 in any or all sextants → Severe or extreme tooth wear → Detailed Tooth Wear Status should be performed </li>
                </ul> 
            </p>

            <h2>Tech stack for a Windows app</h2>
            <p>
                According to the requirements, we are supposed to implement a Windows app which allows dentists to upload patient information and 3D teeth scans and then generate a proper treatment suggestion based on the tooth wear grading. We discussed how to design this app in the meeting and found Python is the best language to implement the backend deep learning model as there are many popular deep learning frameworks used in industry and academia, such as Tensorflow and Pytorch. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of the front-end, we agreed on using C# as it is one of the most popular languages for building a windows app. 
            </p>
            <h2>Deep learning architectures on 3D models</h2>
            <p>
                “Automatic Classification and Segmentation of Teeth on 3D Dental Model Using Hierarchical Deep Learning Networks” introduced a novel approach based on the sparse voxel octree and 3D convolution neural networks for segmenting and classifying on the 3D dental models. As CNN is good at learning image features and is the most robust architecture in computer vision fields, we went deep into this paper to get a general idea of how to use CNNs on 3D dental models specifically.
