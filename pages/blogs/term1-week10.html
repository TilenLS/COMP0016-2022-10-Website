            <h1>Week 10: Literature review completed (Dec 12 - Dec 18)</h1>
            <h2>OrthoAid</h2>
            <p>
                While doing our research on tooth meta tagging, we found a windows-based app developed by the Shahid Beheshti University 
                of Medical Sciences (SBMU) in collaboration with the University of British Columbia (UBC), whose purpose is to help 
                orthodontists analyse pre and post operative 3D dental study models. This app can display 3D tooth models in ply format and
                is written in C#. The app has MIT license, and it solves the problem of displaying ply file format, so we plan to modify 
                their source code to be used in our app. Their source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/amir-abdi/OrthoAid">here</a>. 
                The picture below displays the user interface of OrthoAid:

            <h2>Testing code in TensorFlow</h2>
            <p>
                At the same time, we tried out some code we found online using TensorFlow library that can perform classification 
                tasks on 3D images. As we haven’t been able to find any open-source tooth model data on the Internet and our client 
                hasn’t give us any data, we could only test the code with normal 3D images of different objects such as tables and 
                chairs.
            </p>
            <h2>Client meeting about TWES 2.0</h2>
            <p>
                Our client proposed to have an online meeting so that he can provide further explanation on the Tooth Wear 
                Evaluation System (TWES 2.0). From the meeting, we learnt more about the purpose of using TWES 2.0, and the goal our app 
                should achieve. TWES 2.0 has two parts, for the first part, Tooth Wear Screening, the AI model should be able to segment 
                the tooth model into six sextant and output the highest grade of each sextant. As for the second part, Tooth Wear Status, 
                the AI model should be able to output the highest grade of each tooth. After having the tooth wear grade, together with the 
                patient information inputted by dentist when using the app, the AI model should be able to analyse the cause of tooth wear 
                (mechanical tooth wear, chemical tooth wear, pathological tooth wear).
            </p>
            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            <p>
                We are done with the literature review and have a clear goal of what our app should aim to achieve. After 
                the Christmas holidays, we will start to develop the MUST have features of our project.
