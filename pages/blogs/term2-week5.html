            <h1>Week 5: A more sophisticated user interface (Feb 6 - Feb 12)</h1>
            <h2>Home page of the user interface completed</h2>
            <p>
                One of the team members completed the main page (home page) of our user interface and he used libraries like 
                qt-pyqt-pyside-custom-widgets to decorate the user interface. It looks much nicer compared to our first version 
                of the application. Hence, we decided that other team members will integrate their code into the main page that 
                was created and use the same theme so that it looks more coordinated. We also decided to merge the add patient 
                details page into the home page as a side bar to provide more convenience to users.
            </p>
            <h2>Merging our code together</h2>
            <p>
                We meet up on Friday to merge our code and resolve all the merge conflicts that we had. We spent quite some time 
                to resolve all the merge conflicts and delete duplicated or conflicted lines of code. We also faced some issues 
                with GitHub merge, but all the problems were resolved at the end of the day. Now the home page of our software 
                looks like this: 
            </p>

            <h2>Looking into server to host the database</h2>
            <p>
                We are suggested by the teaching assistant to look into hosting our database on cloud such as Microsoft Azure and 
                also concurrency issues that might occur with the database. Next week is reading week hence we can have some time 
                to look into solutions for these problems.
            </p>
            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            <p>
                We will look into hosting our database on cloud and further improve our software by adding more functionalities.
