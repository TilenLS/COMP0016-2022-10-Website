                <p>
                    Doing research for this project was extremley crucial as we were
                    not building on top of previous work. This had to be done from scratch
                    and related work is sparse. Especially when in the context of industry,
                    most work that has been is purely academic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to this academic nature of the project we had to first familiarse
                    ourselves with concrete work that has been done in the field. Including
                    Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), 3D tooth models, tooth wear
                    indices, and tooth grading algorithms.

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Clinical Decision Support System</h3>
                <p>
                    Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are systems intended to
                    improve healthcare delivery by enhacning medical decision-making
                    capabilities with targeted clinical knowledge, patient-information,
                    and other health information. It is key here to note that the ultimate
                    goal is to assist clinicians in their work and not replace it.

                <h3 class="section-subheading">3D Tooth Models</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the core goals of this project is to ensure that it works
                    with 3D tooth models. The reason for this is due to the greater
                    detail in 3D models as opposed to 2D scan has greater potential
                    for more accurate analysis of tooth wear. This is primarly through
                    analysis of the volumetric loss of the teeth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most common file format for such 3D models is STL which is most
                    commonly used for 3D printing. A less common format is PLY that is
                    very similar to STL, but also perserves the color of the model.
                    This is useful as discoloration is often a key indicator of the
                    severity of tooth wear.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Tooth Wear Indices</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to convert tooth wear analysis into tangible and useable
                    information we had to use Tooth Wear Indices as a basis for any
                    algorithms that will provide clinicians with suggestions. Fortunately,
                    there has been plenty of work done within this field. Below are the
                    three most prominant indeces.

                    After considering all the literature we had read we were uncertain
                    and decided to ask our client whose medicla knowledge and experience
                    would be helpful. After discussing with our client we concluded that
                    TWES 2.0 would be the best option. This is because it provides 5 simple
                    answers but the classification by which a degree of tooth wear is placed
                    into a specific level is very robust.
