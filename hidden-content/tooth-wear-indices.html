            <p>
                In order to convert tooth wear analysis into tangible and useable
                information we had to use Tooth Wear Indices as a basis for any
                algorithms that will provide clinicians with suggestions. Fortunately,
                there has been plenty of work done within this field. Below are the
                three most prominant indices.

            <p>
                After considering all the literature we had read, we were uncertain
                and decided to ask our client whose medical knowledge and experience
                would be helpful. After discussing with our client, we concluded that
                TWES 2.0 would be the best option. This is because it provides 5 simple
                answers but the classification by which a degree of tooth wear is placed
                into a specific level is very robust.
