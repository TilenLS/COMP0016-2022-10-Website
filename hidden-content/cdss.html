            <p>
                Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are systems intended to
                improve healthcare delivery by enhancing medical decision-making
                capabilities with targeted clinical knowledge, patient information,
                and other health information. Below is the general structure of such
                a system. It is key here to note that the ultimate goal is to assist
                clinicians in their work and not replace it.

                    There are also different kinds of CDSS that use different methods to
                    provide support to clinicians. A few can be seen below.
