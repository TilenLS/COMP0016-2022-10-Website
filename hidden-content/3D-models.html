            <p>
                One of the core goals of this project is to ensure that it works
                with 3D tooth models. The reason for this is due to the greater
                detail in 3D models as opposed to 2D scans which has greater potential
                for more accurate analysis of tooth wear through volumetric loss and
                structural irregularity.

                The most common file format for such 3D models is STL which is most
                commonly used for 3D printing. A less common format is PLY that is
                very similar to STL, but also perserves the color of the model.
                This is useful as discoloration is often a key indicator of the
                severity of tooth wear.
