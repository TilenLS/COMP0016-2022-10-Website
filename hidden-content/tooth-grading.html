            <h4>Research in deep learning with tooth evaluation</h5>
                <p>
                    The main algorithms that have been used in academia for tooth evaluation are classification,
                    segmentation, and grading algorithms. The classification and segmantation
                    algorithms are usually used to identify individual teeth and classify whether they are
                    incisors, canines, premolars, or molars. The figure<sup>7</sup> below shows an example of the
                    proces:

                <div class="image-grid">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col"><img src="images/3D-segmentation.png" width="70%"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-3"></div>
                        <div class="col  align-self-center"><img src="images/SegmentedTeeth.png" width="70%"></div>
                        <div class="col-3"></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the issue with such algorithms is that they are very specialised for 3D tooth
                    models. Neither the patient dataset or algorithms are open source let alone optimised
                    for industrial use. Therefore, we had to settle for a more general purpose architecture with
                    proven performence on a public dataset.

                <h4>Research in Point Cloud</h5>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned in the client requirements, the input of the Deep Learning (DL) model is in the PLY
                        format. To be
                        more specific, it is a point cloud which consists of thousands of points with x, y, and z
                        coordinates. This figure<sup>9</sup> shows an overview of the related research in point cloud DL
                        models,
                        and we mainly focused on the classification (highlighted in red). This is most relevant to our
                        project as we can transfer the classification model to a regression model for tooth grading.

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        One such model which belongs to PointWise MLP Methods is the PointNet<sup>8</sup> neural
                        network. The PointNet model solved two key issues caused by the properties of point cloud data:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="num-list">
                        <li>Permutation Invariance (Unordered): the oder of points should not affect results</li>
                        <li>Transformation Invariance: rotating and translating points should not affect results</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The theoretical PointNet architecture is shown in the figure below:
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        PointNet achieves a state-of-the-art performance on some public datasets (eg. ModelNet40).
                        It also proves its robustness on deleting points, inserting outliers, and adding Gaussian noise.
