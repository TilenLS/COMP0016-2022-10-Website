            <p>
                The main algorithms that have been used in academic work for tooth wear
                grading are classification and segmentation. Then followed by the actual
                grading algorithm. There are various approaches and different models
                to achieve this but most first classify the various kind of teeth
                and then segment them. Once the individual tooth has been isolated, it can
                be graded through any ML or AI based method that considers volumetric loss
                and discoloration.

                However, the issue with such algorithms is that they are very specialised
                particularly for 3D tooth models. They are not open source and optimised
                for industrial use yet. Therefore, we had to settle for a more general
                purpose architecture and trade off some accuracy for effiency. One such
                model that is well known is the PointNet network. Its general structure
                is depicted below.
