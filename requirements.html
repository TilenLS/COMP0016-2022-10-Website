                    This is a project with Junaid Saleem Malik of the UCL Eastman Dental Institute.
                    We were presented with the utility of clinical decision support systems to provide
                    systematic and unified decision-making for treating dental disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This has been explored and implemented quite widely within the field of prosthodontics.
                    However, this technology has yet to break into the prosthodontic management of tooth wear
                    due to the number of varying treatment approaches present. There are even several indices
                    to grade tooth wear.

                <p>
                    After recieving our client brief and familiarising ourselves with the project background, we
                    set up an initial meeting with our client to better understand what they expect from the project
                    and the overall main goals of the project. We also agreed upon a weekly meeting to ensure
                    everyone is up to date with the progress of the project and recieve regular feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the initial meeting, we had some clear ideas of what our client expects of the project.
                    Below are the main requirements they pointed out:

                <p>
                    The overarching goal of this project is to develop a windows based app that can work as a
                    Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) by providing dentists with treatment plan suggestions
                    based on an input of a 3D tooth scan and patient metadata.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This should include capabilities such as: rendering of STL/PLY files, storage of tooth models
                    and patient data in a database, an Artificial Intelligence based engine for grading tooth wear
                    and suggesting treatment plans. The app itself should also have a straightforward UI that will
                    reduce the amount of friction in work for dentists who would be using the app regularly.

            <div class="text-box">
                <p>
                    To get a better understanding of more specific features and behaviours the app should contain,
                    we had to conduct user interviews. After considering various methods, we decided the most suitable
                    approach would be a semi-structured interview with straight-forward and open-ended questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was done with all three team members and an interviewee over teams in an informal setting.
                    This seemed optimal as such a dialogue would be less restrictive to the user's point of view
                    which is crucial as it is precisely their perspective we are aiming to understand better.

                            There is some work done but only with 2D scans and its very technical. Otherwise,
                            only some academic work.

                            PLY file format is preferred over STL as it preserves the colour of the model which is

                            Software should identify teeth and tag/highlight areas of the teeth, whether that is

                            loss, prosthetic, discolouration… Then the software should provide a clinician with
                            information
                            useful for treatment plan development.

                            From the perspective that the app is fully delivered, it will aid in diagnosis of tooth

                            help develop prognosis, and assist in suggesting treatment plans. This could also
                            potentially
                            expand to other fields in medicine where analysis of 3D models is similarly pertinent.
